# financial-chatbot
This project is a simple financial analysis chatbot built using Python and pandas. It responds to predefined queries about Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple’s financial data (2022–2024) from an Excel file. Users can ask questions like "What is the total revenue?" and get the relevant financial data.
